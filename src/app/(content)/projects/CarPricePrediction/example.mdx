### Feature Engineering and Naive Modeling

We then focused on feature engineering, creating new features like `carspace`, `averagempg`, and `performancebalance` to capture more information. Simple models like Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Ridge Regression were implemented to establish a baseline performance.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Featuretools

**Key Takeaways:**
- Thoughtful feature engineering can significantly enhance model accuracy.
- Baseline models provide a useful point of comparison for future enhancements.

### Combating Overfitting with Regularization

To prevent overfitting, we introduced regularization techniques such as Lasso and Ridge Regression. These methods reduced model complexity while maintaining performance, ensuring that the models could generalize well to unseen data.

**Models Used:**
- Lasso Regression
- Ridge Regression

**Key Insights:**
- Regularization is essential to avoid overfitting, especially with complex models.

### Error Analysis and Model Refinement

An in-depth error analysis was conducted to diagnose model performance and identify areas for improvement. Based on the analysis, adjustments were made to further refine the models and improve accuracy.

**Technologies Used:**
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas

**Key Takeaways:**
- Error analysis is vital for identifying and correcting model weaknesses.
