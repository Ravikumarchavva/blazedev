### Feature Engineering and Model Selection

To enhance model performance, we engineered features such as run rates, player form, and pitch conditions. We then implemented various models to establish baselines and selected the best-performing ones for further tuning.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, PyTorch

**Key Takeaways:**
- Feature engineering significantly impacts model accuracy and reliability.

### Handling Data Imbalance with SMOTE

Given the imbalance in match outcomes, we applied Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the classes. This improved the modelâ€™s ability to predict wins and losses more effectively.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Libraries:** Imbalanced-learn

**Key Insights:**
- Addressing class imbalance is vital for enhancing model precision and recall.

### Error Analysis and Model Refinement

We conducted thorough error analysis to understand mispredictions and refined our models by incorporating ensemble techniques and hyperparameter tuning, leading to improved decision boundaries and prediction accuracy.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, PyTorch

**Key Takeaways:**
- Continuous error analysis is essential for model refinement and performance enhancement.
