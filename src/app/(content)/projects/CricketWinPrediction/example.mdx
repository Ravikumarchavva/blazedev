## Data Collection and Building Pipeline

### Data Collection

We began by gathering data from sources like Cricsheet and ESPN cricket stats. Necessary preprocessing steps included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key patterns and relationships in the match data.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Data Processing:** Apache Airflow, Apache Spark
- **Storage:** Hadoop HDFS

### Building the Pipeline

Utilizing **Apache Airflow**, we orchestrated the data pipeline to ensure efficient data flow and management. The pipeline includes data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes, enabling seamless integration of diverse data sources.

**Key Components:**
- **ETL Orchestration:** Apache Airflow
- **Data Transformation:** Apache Spark
- **Storage Management:** Hadoop HDFS
